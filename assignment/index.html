        <li class="aboutMe">Hello! My name is Brady Baker, and I am currently a full-time athletic
        trainer at the University of Minnesota. Before Minnesota, I was an intern
        at the University of Colorado and completed my gradute assistantship at the
        Universtiy of Illinois! Now my journey has brought me to Prime and I
        couldn't be more excited to get started!</li>
        <li class="aboutMe">I am originally from Wichita, Kansas, but I was rasied most of my life
        in a small town in Missouri named Monroe City. That's where my favorite
        little people in the world live (pictured above)! Those are my nieces
        and nephew Lucy, Reagan, and Ryland! If I'm not beating them in a
        game of PIG, you can find us playing video games or board games all day
        long! They are seriously the best. </li>
        <li class="aboutMe">My current job consumes a lot of my time, but when I have some free time
        you can find me doing a multitude of things! My main hobby is working out or
        being active in some way. I also really enjoy cooking, trying new
        recipes, and hosting. I usually host a dinner party once a week with friends!
        If I'm feeling lazy I'll be on the Xbox with friends playing whatever we
        decide to tackle on the Game Pass.</li>
